This application creates a functional To-Do List. Run it and enter commands in the CLI to add items to your list, remove items from your list, change the status of items in your list, or simply view your list.

The objective of this project was to reinforce my understanding of Python syntax, data types, control structures (to be honest, I'm not sure what this means; I assume using conditionals to control the flow of the program), functions, and error handling while building a practical and interactive application.

Enjoy!
